This folder contains essentially the same code as in 02_load_picture but I have
refactored both the c code and forth to be more idiomatic respectively.

Prerequisites:
sdl2
gforth
gcc

To build the c code:
gcc game.c -o game.exe $(sdl2-config --cflags) $(sdl2-config --libs)

To run the c code:
./game.exe

To run the forth version:
gforth game.fs
